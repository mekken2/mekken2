I'm Prince, a highschool student whose interest in programming sparked 3 years ago with Java and a little bit of Pen testing and hacking. And then it was like a never-ending adventurous book, I got fairly experienced with Python,Java,JavaScript,HTML and CSS. I love Algorithms and Data Structures, designing and coding websites, and my Ultimate goal is AI.
